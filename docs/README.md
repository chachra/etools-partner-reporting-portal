# PRP Documentation

PRP stands for **Partner Reporting Portal**.

It's a web application built by [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/) to ease the reporting of data by its partners in the context of IP \(Implementing Partner\) reporting and also in the context of [Cluster](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/clusters) reporting.

PRP is an open-source project and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/unicef/etools-partner-reporting-portal/).

## IP and Cluster Reporting

PRP consists of two somewhat distinct user experiences targeting different but potentially overlapping use-cases. This is what is referred to as [IP](product-end-user-documentation/ip-reporting/README.md) and [Cluster Reporting](product-end-user-documentation/cluster-reporting/README.md). More details if you click on each of them in the left hand navigation.

Both of these sub-systems is built on top of the same [data model](technical-documentation/data-model.md) and all the data is stored in the same database.

## Design Philosophy

The UX / visual design philosophy builds on [Google Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/), with variations.

The technical design philosophy for PRP builds on what has already been established by the eTools team at UNICEF. More information here: [https://github.com/unicef/etools](https://github.com/unicef/etools)
