# Calculating progress

For a particular reporting period a partner will report progress on an indicator for one or more locations. To capture the progress made on that indicator across all locations, we need a way to calculate it. This is referred to as **"calculation method across locations"**.

Once multiple indicator reports have been submitted for a particular indicator then we need a way to calculate  cumulative progress on that indicator. This is referred to as **"calculation method across reporting periods"**.

There are three methods of calculation that are supported in PRP for both the above:

1. **Sum** - progress is calculated by simply adding.
2. **Max** - the max total becomes the progress.
3. **Avg** - an average of all the totals is taken.

For one indicator report for one location, the progress is always calculated by simply summing the data reported.
