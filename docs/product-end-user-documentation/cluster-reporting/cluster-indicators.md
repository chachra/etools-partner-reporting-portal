# Cluster Indicators

Indicators in a cluster can belong to following entities:

* Cluster Objective
* Cluster Activity
* Partner Project
* Project Activity: Either one of these
  * Custom
  * Associated with Cluster activity



### Add Indicator Modal

IMOs and partners can create their own indicators. They can choose the type of indicator \(quantity, percent, ratio\) and calculation method for reporting periods/locations.

IMO's set baseline, target at the indicator level. If this is a Partner indicator, they can set these too. In-need is optional. If baseline is not set, it default's to 0.

At the location level, IMO can set the admin level and specific location pertaining to the level. In-need is optional to set here. IMOs can add multiple locations and disaggregations too.

For Percentage Indicator, we have added 2 labels for numerator and denominator. We won’t have In-need. We’re only going to take one number for each label. The calculation method will be greyed out.

**When it’s Ratio Indicator, we will have 2 labels, and will take 2 \#s \(numerator and denominator\) for baseline and target. The calculation method will be greyed out.

IMO or Partner can edit an indicator. The location admin level, specific location previously, and disaggregations set are not editable. Locations can be added though.

Partners can adopt Activity Indicators previously set by the IMO. They are able to edit the target and add locations. If the partner adds a location, they will be able to include the administration level, specific location for the level and target.

If the Partner would like to propose a new Baseline and in-need to the IMO, they can send a direct message to the IMO. This will be sent to the IMO's email.

### Showing Current Progress against Target and against In-Need

For Quantity Indicators, IMOs will be able to enter new baseline and In-Need for specific locations in bulk. In-need is optional and Baseline defaults to 0.

For Percent Indicators, IMOs will be able to enter a new Baseline. It defaults to 0.

For Ratio Indicators, IMOs will be able to enter a new Baseline. The data key specifies the numerator and denominator.
