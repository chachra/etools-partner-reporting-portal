description: Summary background on IP Reporting

# Overview

The goal of IP Reporting in PRP is to enable partners and their users to be able to report on various PD's on a regular interval as agreed upon with UNICEF.

The system supports different partner [roles and permissions](partner-roles-and-permissions.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Only partners sign in to PRP IP Reporting** and PO's do not use or interface with PRP directly at all. Their main interface to access progress reports and hence progress on indicators is in PMP itself.
{% endhint %}



Some of the things a partner can do in PRP IP Reporting \(more details in the [user interface](user-interface.md) section\):

* View their details.
* View their current PD's and associated details for each.
* View their upcoming, due, submitted progress reports.
* View progress on indicators irrespective of which PD's they belong to.
