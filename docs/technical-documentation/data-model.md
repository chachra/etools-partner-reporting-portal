The high-level conceptual data model for the product is below. Its designed in a way to support the requirements of generic reporting against indicators, but also specific reporting requirements that may come along.

{% hint style="info" %}
The indicators \(Reportables in the data model\) can be associated via a generic foreign key to any other model, keeping it generic and expandable in the future
{% endhint %}
